# GitSafeDelete
Software made in C++ and bash which looks for keywords in git history and spits out the commit information, date and time of the commit which matches the keyword. Just clone the github repo with `git clone https://github.com/BSardana01/GitSafeDelete.git` and run the pre-compiled binary with `./findSensitiveInfo`.

Thanks to [@Tomnomnom](https://twitter.com/TomNomNom) for the amazing bash script. Check out this [video](https://youtu.be/l8iXMgk2nnY) by Stok to get an idea for this script.
