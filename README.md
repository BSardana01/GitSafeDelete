# GitSafeDelete
Software made in C++ and bash which looks for keywords in git history and spits out the commit information, date and time of the commit which matches the keyword. 

Clone the github repo with `git clone https://github.com/BSardana01/GitSafeDelete.git`, compile c++ file with `g++ findSesitiveInfo.cpp -o findSensitiveInfo` and run the compiled binary with `./findSensitiveInfo`.

Thanks to [@Tomnomnom](https://twitter.com/TomNomNom) for the amazing bash script. Check out this [video](https://youtu.be/l8iXMgk2nnY) by St√∂k to get an idea for this script.
